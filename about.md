Iâ€™m Youngsun Kim, a researcher, educator, and professional specializing in risk management and actuarial science. My research spans interdisciplinary areas, including predictive analytics in actuarial science, socioeconomic access to insurance, and the impact of natural hazards on insurance pricing.

I received my B.A. degree in [Public Administration][kupa] from [Korea University][ku] (KU) in 2009.
After graduation, I joined my family business and worked as an operations assistant until the end of 2012.
In 2013, I moved to the United States to start my Master's study in Risk Management and Insurance and Actuarial Science at [Georgia State University][gsu].
In 2015, I moved back to South Korea and started my insurance consulting career at [Towers Watson][tw] as an Actuarial Analyst.
After two and a half wonderful years, I chose to pursue my dream of studying towards a PhD.
In 2018, I joined the PhD program in Insurance Economics and Actuarial Analytics offered by the Risk and Insurance Department at the Wisconsin School of Business [Wisconsin School of Business][wsb].
